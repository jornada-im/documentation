To whom it may concern,

The student ***Arthur Tansley*** has, within the last year, completed the data and metadata submission requirements for funding by the Jornada Graduate Research Fellowship Program ("the fellowship"). These requirements include:

1. Submission of one or more files containing data collected as part of a graduate research project associated with their degree program and the fellowship.

2. Submission of a complete metadata template describing the data in the file(s) above.

3. The student agrees to publicly release these data and metadata within one year of completing the degree program, or at the time the data are published in the peer-reviewed scientific literature (whichever occurs first).

The submitted data and metadata items (1 & 2) have been reviewed by the Jornada Basin LTER Information Manager and archived in the Jornada file system. Published products are listed below. Inclusion of this statement in a fellowship application constitutes the student's agreement to requirement 3 and supports continued eligibility for the fellowship.
