To whom it may concern,

\vspace{2mm}

The student ***Sir Arthur George Tansley*** has, within the last year, completed the data and metadata submission requirements for funding by the Jornada Basin LTER Graduate Research Fellowship Program ("the fellowship"). These requirements include:

1. Submission of one or more files containing data collected as part of a graduate research project associated with their degree program and the fellowship.

2. Submission of a complete metadata template describing the data in the file(s) above.

3. The student agrees to publicly release these data and metadata within 2 years of completing the degree program, or at the time the data are published in the peer-reviewed scientific literature (whichever occurs first).

The submitted data and metadata items (1 & 2) have been reviewed by the Jornada Basin LTER Information Manager and archived in the Jornada file system. Inclusion of this statement in a fellowship application constitutes the student's agreement to requirement 3 and supports continued eligibility for the fellowship.
