# Data Management Plan 

_Note: This data management plan is an update to the one in the 2020 JRN LTER-VII proposal._

## Introduction

The Jornada Basin LTER program (JRN) supports an effective and well-integrated information management (IM) program and shares the LTER Network view that published datasets are a first-class product of our research, and an opportunity for outreach and education. The JRN Information Management (IM) system is run by the JRN IM team, which operates with three core priorities.

1. Contribute to high quality, impactful ecology research at all stages of the data life cycle
2. Oversee, or directly handle, publication of all Jornada datasets
3. Act as a source of data-related leadership, education, and outreach

The IM team approaches each of these priorities with a philosophy of openness to diverse stakeholders, including scientists, resource managers, students, & the public, an a commitment to the principles of open scientific research. 

The JRN IM team has designed and implemented an IM system that reliably performs a sequence of critical data management functions. First, efficient systems to collect, quality-assure, document, and archive research data are well integrated among JRN research groups, including the LTER field crew responsible for collecting many core, long-term, datasets. Next, the IM team rapidly ensures that research data are quality checked and assured and then documented with complete, standardized metadata. This leads directly to timely publication of Jornada data and metadata in community-standard research data repositories. Finally, the IM team provides numerous means to discover and access published data through the JRN website and other outlets. JRN information managers also continually promote re-use of published data, and directly assist researchers with data access, analysis and interpretation. In addition to its central role at JRN, the IM team also interacts beyond the JRN research community and is committed to advancing sound data management and sharing practices through leadership and educational activities with Jornada community partners, the LTER Network, and the environmental research, data science, and data management communities generally.

In this Data Management Plan, we outline the JRN strategy for managing research data over the next 6 year cycle of Jornada funding. In the four years since JRN's most recent renewal proposal, Jornada data management practices have evolved, and the IM system has developed a range of new features. These advancements will be key to allowing JRN IM to (a) continue meeting the three core priorities outlined above, including consistently publishing and updating Jornada research data, and (b) rise to meet new data management challenges, of which there are several in the current proposal.

[ (1) hired a new lead IM (Dr. Greg Maurer, started May 1, 2019), who regularly interacts with LTER Network IMs to learn about technologies, standards, and best-practices and then incorporates them into the JRN IM system; (2) focused our efforts over the past 18 months on writing and updating metadata and publishing new data to EDI, prioritizing our signature datasets (long-term, widely used in JRN or LTER network research); (3) developed the 5 IM priorities listed above; (4) created a new website data catalog that is directly synchronized with the JRN catalog at the EDI data repository; (5) updated our bibliography and personnel information and refreshed the look and feel of the JRN website; and (6) improved communication between the IM team and JRN scientists so they will be aware of, and compliant with, NSF, LTER Network, and JRN data policies. We anticipate that recent modifications to our personnel and practices, as described below, have greatly improved JRN data management and will restore our role as a leader in LTER IM in coming years.]


## IM resources

__Personnel__: The JRN "IM team" is headed by G. Maurer. Supported at 0.5 FTE by JRN, Maurer brings a combination of ecological research experience, analytical skills, and data management expertise to the project. He leads a team comprised of a part-time computer programmer with machine learning expertise (Dr. Geovany Ramirez), full-time site and long-term data manager John Anderson, and part-time undergraduate assistant Gillian Trujillo. The JRN group collaborates closely with USDA data managers, including statistician Darren James who assists Maurer with data quality assurance, metadata preparation, and dataset publication. JRN Project manager Madeleine Soss is partially responsible for JRN website content and maintaining communication channels with researchers and staff. USDA staff Scott Schrader and Ken Ramsey assist with local IT tasks, such as managing shared network resources. IM team lead Maurer meets at least monthly with members of the JRN PI leadership team to help align IM goals with research priorities, and promote new standards and procedures.


__Computing and storage infrastructure__: The JRN IM system is built from a diverse array of technologies and infrastructure resources. The IM team ensures that these resources provide secure, resilient computing and storage capabilities for JRN personnel, external collaborators, and the public. The JRN LTER is housed in Wooton Hall, headquarters of the USDA-ARS Jornada Experimental Range (JER), on the New Mexico State University (NMSU) campus. A long-standing ARS-LTER agreement allows the JER to provide and manage some elements of computing infrastructure that JRN requires (Table 1), including a cluster of servers with a 100TB storage block from which JRN staff are provided with CIFS shares for networked file storage. Most JRN research data, IM-related metadata and tools, and staff files and documents (e.g., images, equipment manuals, procedures documents) are stored on these network shares. Most other infrastructure has transitioned to cloud-based systems in the last four years (Table 1), which has reduced maintenance demands and increased reliability and uptime. The IM team maintains a Linux virtual machine and S3-compatible object store at DigitalOcean.com to host a team metadata database (PostgreSQL 12, following the `LTER-core_metabase` schema), web-accessible storage for data objects (upon publication to EDI), and full offsite backups of local Jornada file storage. The JRN website is built in WordPress and includes several associated data catalog and bibliography applications built in Javascript, all of which are hosted at WPengine.com. The JRN data catalogs and bibliography apps featured on the website access data stores at the Environmental Data Initiative (EDI) repository, Zotero.org, and NMSU's ArcGIS Online instance. Shinyapps.io hosts R Shiny applications including the interactive data viewer also visible on the JRN website. All cloud-based systems have a minimum of nightly backups with distributed storage and rollback ability. The JRN IM team backs up all local network storage nightly to an in-house device and to the DigitalOcean S3 bucket, which is in addition to the weekly, off-site tape-drive backups of the same data performed by USDA-ARS staff. Periodic technology transfers happen on a 3-5 year cycle and update hardware, software, and file formats to ensure long-term data protection against media or format obsolescence. The JRN IM team and researchers also use a variety of secure cloud platforms (e.g. _Trello_, _GitHub_) to store and manage documentation, code, and other project data. Collaboration with off-site JRN personnel is usually accomplished using _Dropbox_ or _Google Drive_ depending on project needs and institutional requirements for project members.

__Network infrastructure__: Servers and staff computers are connected to a Gigabit local area network (LAN) linked to the NMSU network (Gigabit Ethernet) through a firewall. Local networked systems and web applications are password-protected, and regular security sweeps identify security threats. The USDA Jornada field headquarters (HQ; centrally located at the LTER research site) is linked to the NMSU network via a 40 MB multi-hop, point-to-point wireless backhaul connection for large-volume data (e.g., streaming meteorological and phenocam data). Field instruments are connected via 900 MHz spread spectrum wireless radios to base stations at HQ. This network allows communication with dataloggers and other research devices to be initiated from anywhere with internet access. Wireless internet at HQ is available for JRN LTER use.

[Need to update this - the JER wireless network and link from HQ to NMSU has been upgraded]


## Elements of the JRN IM system

The JRN IM system consists of several interrelated components functioning together to create, manage, and distribute research data, metadata, and ancillary information. Wherever possible the JRN IM team uses community-standard tools and practices that are are documented and shared, along with JRN-developed software tools, in the group's public _GitHub_ organization (`jornada-im`) The important components of the JRN IM system are described below with explanations of how they are accessible to the public. The JRN IM system integrates with all stages of the DataOne data life cycle, which are identified in parentheses in section headings below.

  <figcaption><em>Figure 1: A simplified schematic of the JRN Information Management system. All activity and data occurring on local infrastructure (in yellow folders) is managed directly by the IM Team.</em></figcaption>
</figure><br><br>

__Data collection and quality assurance (Collect, Assure)__: Research data generally enters the JRN IM system by one of four routes: (1) entry of long-term datasets manually collected by the 3-person JRN field crew, (2) autonomous data collection by sensor networks and dataloggers (3) data submission by LTER investigators and students, or (4) data submission by collaborators not directly managed by JRN. For data category (1), data are collected on a schedule that varies depending on the project, and site manager Anderson is responsible for archiving raw files and managing data entry/transcription and validation procedures. Anderson works closely with the rest of the IM team to quality assure and check (QA/QC) new data and produce files suitable for publication. To optimize efficiency, custom scripts and spreadsheets (in _R_, _Python_, _Matlab_, or _Excel_) have been developed to assist with QA/QC and generate output files. JRN also uses the USDA-developed DIMA database installed on field tablets, which permits data quality control at the time of collection. For (2), we have adopted the _MATLAB GCE Toolbox_ (developed at GCE LTER) for data QA/QC, and have extended its functionality to allow rapid data flagging and publication to EDI using software extensions developed by Anderson and Ramirez. For data category (3), students and investigators QA/QC their own data and submit it with appropriate metadata to the IM team on a timeframe matching the JRN and LTER data access policies (see below). The IM team communicates regularly with investigators and graduate students to track research progress, request data and metadata submission, and raise awareness of current and developing LTER Network data management practices and expectations. 
Metadata may be submitted to the IM team using EDI's _ezEML_ tool, or one of the JRN metadata templates (MS Word or Excel formats). Once data and metadata are submitted, the IM team applies an additional layer of standardization and quality control using database validation and custom R scripts (Fig. 1). For data category (4), collaborators not directly involved with JRN, we provide access to data standards and archival storage upon request. For example, JRN LTER has been instrumental in developing data standards and publishing workflows for the Long-Term Agroecosystems Network (Spiegal et al. 2019). 

__Data packaging and publishing (Describe, Preserve)__: A primary function of the JRN IM system is to create and distribute research datasets that are findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR, **citation**). These datasets must therefore consist of quality-assured data and rich, detailed metadata published together in community-accepted online data repositories. There is considerable variety in data type (tabular, spatial, imagery, etc.), structure (variables, resolution, etc.), and source (long-term monitoring, JRN investigators, collaborating research networks, etc.) among JRN datasets. Accordingly, the IM team has developed a flexible and powerful system to create and publish these datasets. All Jornada research metadata are stored and managed in a relational database following the `LTER-core_metabase` schema, which is maintained by a working group of the LTER Network Information Management Committee (IMC). This system validates incoming metadata and helps enforce standards, such as using the LTER Controlled Vocabulary and Standard Units Dictionary. JRN also uses a limited set of its own metadata standards that have been developed over years of consultation with Jornada data providers (documented in the `jornada-im` _GitHub_ organization).

At the time of dataset publication, the IM team error-checks data, outputs them to an accepted format, and generates a metadata file to describe the data. The `LTER-core_metabase` schema is designed for generation of XML metadata documents formatted to the Ecological Metadata Language (EML) 2.2 standard. In coordination with other LTER IMs, JRN has developed an _R_-based pipeline to create EML documents from the database and publish the resulting datasets to the EDI data repository's Provenance Aware Synthesis Tracking Architecture system (_PASTA+_). Upon upload of EML and associated data entities to EDI, the consistency and integrity of JRN data and metadata is checked again by the _PASTA+_ system. Datasets held at EDI constitute the primary JRN data catalog (Fig. 1), and the IM team prioritizes adding all new or as-yet unpublished datasets to this repository. For specialized datasets that are more logically archived in repositories other than EDI (e.g, AmeriFlux, NCBI), citations are entered into Zotero and presented in a non-EDI data catalog, which allows **tracking and discovery of all JRN datasets across multiple repositories**. We have published 117 new datasets to EDI since our 2018 panel review (the majority from our many meteorological stations), **a 124% increase over the prior 4 years, and we now publish streaming data from 15 weather stations on a monthly schedule** (Fig. 2).

__The JRN website (Plan, Discover)__: The JRN website (<https://lter.jornada.nmsu.edu>) is the central means of exposing all aspects of research, as well as education and outreach activities, to JRN scientists and staff, external collaborators, and the public in an accessible and user-friendly way. It is also the gateway for discovery and access to JRN data. The site is jointly maintained by the JRN IM team and program manager, and the computing resources and software powering the website are described in Table 1. Key elements of the JRN website are:

* _Researcher information_: The JRN website prioritizes direct communication with the program's researchers and staff. The "For Researchers" menu covers important topics such as (a) procedures for initiating new research, (b) fieldwork information and safety guidelines, (c) conduct and inclusive research expectations, (d) incident reporting, and (e) expectations and procedures for contributing to the Jornada data commons. The IM team tries to make this content accessible, clear, and actionable for active JRN personnel.

* _Data catalog_: The JRN data catalog is multi-faceted and can be browsed and searched on the JRN website. Results in our primary data catalog link directly to package landing pages on EDI. The website data catalog queries the EDI repository using the _PASTA+_ API, meaning search results from the website data catalog always reflect the current JRN holdings on EDI. Other facets of the data catalog allow discovery of non-EDI datasets, spatial data, and data from Jornada's non-LTER research partners.

* _Publication list_: The IM team manages a bibliography containing all JRN publications (including peer-reviewed journal articles, book chapters, reports, and theses) using _Zotero_. New publications are identified through reporting by PIs or the Site Research Manager, and Google Scholar alerts. The bibliography can be browsed and searched using a Javascript tool developed by the LTER community.

* _Personnel lists_: Current JRN personnel are featured on the website using a WordPress plugin, and JRN also maintains an extensive personnel database reaching back to the beginning of the program. That database includes cooperating staff and scientists in the co-located USDA-ARS Jornada Experimental Range and outside collaborators. Personnel records are updated twice yearly at a minimum. 

* _Site background and current research_: The combined research history at JRN LTER and USDA JER reaches back over a century (1915), and JRN has numerous ongoing long- and short-term research and monitoring projects. This complex scientific enterprise can be challenging to communicate to new personnel, collaborators, data users, and the public. For this reason, a number of site descriptions, research vignettes, maps, and other interpretive materials are made available on the JRN website. These materials are periodically revised and updated to reflect new research results, priorities, and other developments. 

* _Synergistic activities and partnerships_: The JRN LTER participates in a number of education and outreach initiatives directly and through partnerships. The JRN website features these through periodic news posts, as well as static web pages devoted to JRN educational programs, fellowship opportunities, outreach activities, and cooperative programs with management agencies or community groups.

__Data archiving and access policies (Preserve, Discover)__: In adherence with the Type I data guidelines described in the LTER Network Data Access Policy, JRN publishes all research data no later than 2 years after collection or at the time of journal article publication. At present, no Type II data are collected at JRN. To make compliance with the LTER policy possible, JRN strongly encourages timely submission and archiving of research data from all supported projects. All JRN investigators and students, particularly those receiving the JRN LTER fellowship or other funds, are required to submit data within a year of research project initiation, and annually thereafter for long-term research. The IM team communicates these requirements directly to PIs and students at JRN meetings and training events, including every summer at the Jornada Desert Ecology Short Course. 

The JRN IM system is designed to distribute data that meets the FAIR principles as thoroughly as possible, and ensures that all datasets in the primary data catalog are publicly accessible in three locations: the JRN website data catalog, the EDI repository (in _PASTA+_), and the DataONE metadata aggregator through EDI's membership. All JRN datasets are published with the Creative Commons "CCBY" or "CC0" license, but there are minor exceptions to JRN's LTER open data policy. Because JRN conducts sensitive research in areas accessible to the public (JER and the Chihuahuan Desert Rangeland Research Center), detailed spatial location data for research sites are withheld from public metadata. Location data are available to researchers upon request from the IM team.

## Additional IM activities

__IM integration with research (Plan, Describe, Integrate, Analyze)__: The IM team works closely with research site manager Anderson, JRN investigators, students, and collaborating scientists to ensure that Jornada research is soundly designed, addresses high-priority JRN research questions, and meets all open science and data management standards and obligations. New research projects are approved by Anderson and details are communicated directly to the IM team. IM team involvement begins early in the research process through consultation with investigators to evaluate research questions, methods, and any infrastructure or instrumentation. The IM team then helps design and initiate plans for efficient, accurate, and complete collection of data and metadata. Any new research methods with unique data demands are evaluated particularly closely. The IM team is also tasked with systematically evaluating long-term JRN datasets to determine their scientific value and impact, and then collaboratively update research methods and data management as needed. For example, JRN IM team members recently convened a working group of JRN investigators, field techs, and USDA statistician Darren James to evaluate and revise the long-term plant phenology data collected at JRN. A new field observation program was created based on National Phenology Network protocols, and the first year of data has been published to EDI.

Members of the IM team participate in JRN research as scientists in several capacities. Lead IM Maurer is a member of the JRN Dryland Modeling team, which is currently expanding the research group's ecological modeling capability. Darren James regularly contributes statistical analyses to Jornada publications. John Anderson contributes to research design, execution, and resulting journal articles for many Jornada research projects. Most members of IM team regularly work directly with students and investigators in the analysis and interpretation of JRN research data and contribute to JRN publications. Lead IM Maurer also collaborates with LTER Network IMs and scientists, and the EDI repository, in the conception, writing, and publishing of articles in ecological informatics and cross-site synthesis.

__Education and outreach__: A key priority for the JRN IM team is to provide data-related leadership, education, and outreach. The IM team continually promotes the importance of Jornada data and sound data management practices, and endeavors to build the literacy and skillsets of Jornada research personnel in these areas. Maurer and James are certified Carpentries instructors and have organized 1-2 scientific programming and data analysis workshops for Jornada personnel each year for the past 3 years. These workshops are supported in part by the New Mexico EPSCoR program. At the _Jornada Desert Ecology Short Course_ that takes place each summer, lead IM Maurer gives a regular presentation introducing Jornada Information Management and providing updates about recent IM developments. The team also organizes ad-hoc events at the Short Course that can include Data Jams (in coordination with Asombro), metadata clinics, or Carpentries workshops. Lead IM Maurer is frequently invited to present on data management with JRN-affiliated lab and student groups at NMSU and the University of Texas-El Paso, and advises students in the Jornada REU program about working with their data. Maurer holds weekly office hours (Data Therapy Thursday) to allow open-format discussion of data (usually), or instructional activities (periodically). Instructional materials on metadata preparation, JRN data access, and data citation are shared with JRN personnel through the website and GitHub repository, and are consistently updated to keep information current. being written to complement all these events.

__Network participation__: Lead IM Maurer actively contributes to the LTER Network's IM activities in several capacities. From 2020-2023 he served on the IM Executive committee for the network, including a term as co-chair. He currently leads a number of working groups in coordination with the EDI repository, including the EML Best Practices and HyMet working groups. Maurer also collaborates with EDI personnel and other LTER site IMs to develop and maintain data management software tools, such as R packages and the `LTER-core metabase` schema. The extensions to the _MATLAB GCE Toolbox_ developed by Geovany Ramirez have been made available to others in LTER and beyond. The JRN IM team also collaborates closely with SEV and MCM LTER LTER IMs to organize educational events such as Carpentries workshops. Several aspects JRN IM work have been presented at conferences (ESIP), the LTER All Scientists Meeting, and the annual IMC meeting, and featured in peer-reviewed journal articles.

## Recent accomplishments and future initiatives

__Milestones in the current funding cycle__: Since renewal of JRN LTER funding in 2020, JRN has focused its efforts on developing more efficient data publishing operations, easing discovery and access for its diverse datasets, and standardizing data and metadata to enhance reusability of JRN data. Milestones we have reached in the past four years include:

1. We created a new metadata database using the _`LTER-core_metabase`_ schema and populated it with the rich metadata that Jornada research programs have accumulated over the past 40 years.
2. The JRN IM team developed new data formatting and metadata content standards, and has applied them to [almost] all datasets in our catalog.
3. New standards and workflows for publishing non-tabular datasets, such as ground-based imagery, remote sensing, and UAS-derived data, have been developed and gone into production at JRN. We have also shared these methods with other data managers in the LTER network.
4. The JRN IM team has maintained a consistent schedule updating the data and metadata (all data current to 2022) for the site's core long-term datasets, and added [over 100] new and previously unpublished datasets from early in the JRN LTER program.
5. We revised our data catalog to enhance discovery and access to three previously neglected categories of JRN data: 1) data published outside of EDI, 2) geospatial data, and 3), data from Jornada's many collaborating research networks and partners. [As stated above], we have also begun working to enhance discovery and access for JRN's collections of physical samples and specimens.

__Future initiatives__: The next six years will bring significant changes to JRN research priorities and data, and the IM team is planning to support these transitions. We also plan to continue making steady improvements to the efficiency of the JRN IM system, and the FAIR status and overall quality of our published data. Planned improvements during LTER-VIII include the following:

1. In JRN VIII the IM team will expand its focus on the re-use of all JRN data. With recent improvements standardizing metadata and publishing JRN datasets, the IM team can successfully devote time to harmonizing data, creating analysis ready data products, and developing analytical applications for researchers. We will use open-source tools like R and Python for this purpose.
2. The Jornada research programs, including JRN, continue to build out sensor network infrastructure to serve monitoring objectives and data collection in experiments. The JRN IM team will implement a new database system and schema for sensor network data, and streamline archiving and real-time access to these data for researchers and the public. This will occur in coordination with the HyMet working group, a joint effort between the LTER Network, EDI, and partners at CUAHSI and the Dendra project. The pilot project for this has already begun.
3. Jornada research programs are investing in, and have proposed in JRN VIII, the collection and analysis of ground-based and aerial imagery (such as phenocam- or UAS-derived photos) as a survey and monitoring method that can complement or replace manual fieldwork. Though these methods are still in early development, we anticipate greater acceptance and use of such techniques in the coming 6 years. The IM team plans to respond with a suitable set of data management protocols and tools.
4. The Jornada Dryland Modeling team is developing ecological modeling capabilities that will (a) consume Jornada observational datasets and other training data, (b) undergo development of the model and its extensions over time, and (c) produce simulation outputs for a variety of research questions and projects. The JRN IM team will be embedded in this modeling effort to ensure that inputs, model development, and simulation outputs will be preserved and accessible to the public.
5. Management of research projects at the Jornada is a time-consuming job spearheaded largely by one person, John Anderson. The JRN IM team has made progress databasing much of the information John collects about JRN research, but we intend to improve the efficiency of project management by letting researchers more easily register and describe their project goals, personnel, and plans. The Jornada also needs methods to deliver important information to researchers, such as safety trainings, inclusive research guidelines, and instructions for submitting data. The JRN IM team will participate in producing a suite of tools to ease and improve project management at the Jornada.
