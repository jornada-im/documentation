# The website data catalogs

The data catalog seen at [https://lter.jornada.nmsu.edu/data-catalog/]([https://lter.jornada.nmsu.edu/data-catalog/) is JRNs primary data catalog and is a javascript app called `lter-datacat`.

## `lter-datacat`

The `lter-datacat` app is written in javascript and was originally developed by Geovany Ramirez and Jason Coombs. It is running on the main data catalog page through an iframe, but the app lives at [https://lter.jornada.nmsu.edu/lter-datacat/](https://lter.jornada.nmsu.edu/lter-datacat/) on the website.

The app is hosted and maintained in [a GitHub repository](https://github.com/jornada-im/lter-datacat)

## Partner data

This is in development on the staging website. It will list data held at repositories other than EDI.

## Spatial data

[The spatial data catalog](https://lter.jornada.nmsu.edu/data-catalog/spatial-data/) is basically just a list of layers that can be downloaded as kmz files. Nothing fancy.
