# Introduction

Our priorities in the Jornada IM team are to:

1. Contribute to high quality, impactful ecology and rangeland research at all stages of the data life cycle.

2. Oversee, or directly handle, publication of all Jornada datasets
    - In the process we ensure data meet [FAIR](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18) data principles & the [LTER Data Access Policy](https://lternet.edu/data-access-policy/).

3. Act as a source of data-related leadership and education
    - We do this through committee & working group participation, open-source software development, outreach activity, and teaching.


# Research project management

Research projects at the Jornada are initiated by requesting approval using John Anderson's "Research notification" process. A summary of this process, and links to relevant documents are on the "For researchers" page of the [JRN](https://lter.jornada.nmsu.edu/for-researchers) and [JER](https) websites.

# Data management

Data management expectations for researchers are also outlined on the [JRN](https://lter.jornada.nmsu.edu/for-researchers) and [JER](https) websites. Field data collection of long-term datasets is typically handled by the Jornada Field Crew, under the supervision of John Anderson.
