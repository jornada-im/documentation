## GNU Mailman lists on lists.nmsu.edu

There are 3 lists assigned to Jornada LTER on NMSU's listserv system:

* JRN-L@lists.nmsu.edu (or JRN-L@nmsu.edu)
    - Used for general-interest email broadcasts to anyone affiliated with the Jornada LTER or voluntarily following this list. People can subscribe to this using a form on our website homepage.
* JRNSTUDENT-L@lists.nmsu.edu (or JRNSTUDENT-L@nmsu.edu)
    - Used mainly by JRN staff to contact graduate and undergraduate students, or of students to broadcast messages for themselves. Anything sent to JRN-L gets sent to this list as well (automatically, without duplicates).
* JRNSTAFF-L@lists.nmsu.edu (or JRNSTAFF-L@nmsu.edu)
    - Currently unused.

To administer these one must be on the NMSU VPN, or on campus, and visit the admin portal for each. The addresses for these are <https://lists.nmsu.edu/mailman/admin/{listname}>, where {listname} is jrn-l, jrnstudent-l, or jrnstaff-l.

### Managing the lists

We use the basic list admin tools provided by Mailman - the site IM and PM mainly handle it (and are still learning).
